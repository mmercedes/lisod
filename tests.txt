I simply used both the echo_client file and cp1_checker.py file provided to me for testing my implementation's correctness.
Since the server simply echoes back the data sent to it, I felt this was sufficient to test it's correctness. I tried a wide variety of arguments for the cp1_checker script however, to get a more accurate judgement of my server's robustness. I also made heavy use of printing to the command line to observe the state of my server at each of it's main phases (accepting a connection, reading from it, writing to it, and any errors that arose). Finally, I used valgrind to assure there were no memory leaks.
